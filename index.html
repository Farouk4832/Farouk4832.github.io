        <p>So its around 7:22pm in Accra-Ghana, the fourth day after my realisation of the saying that "it isn't easy to be an adult. I have been moved from my room to my little brother's room as a punishment for staying in my room alot and not taking part in activities around me.This is my second day of using Khan Academy to study html. I must say I have advanced very quickly.I already had a fair knowledge about web design from a boot camp organized by <em><a href="http://www.elite-education.org/#home" target="_blank">ELiTE</a></em>. I am on the fourth topic in this course so far my journey with Khan Academy has been interesting. The lady's voice makes it soothing to follow....lol .So I am done with CSS text properties I hope to start the next opic which is "web development tools". Right now I am writting this blog as a project at the end of the fourth topic.&lt&lt&lt(while writting that I had to attend to some domestic issues. I was just trying to find the perfect learning pattern for myself today so I tried the technique I have been using already; which is to sleep during the day and learn at night but that also coincides with what I have to do during the day and if I tried it the oppposite way I will be distracted by my sibilings or that is just a flimsy excuse?. Yesterday I made a website about recipes, I am acctually new to this journal thing. I am used to keeping my plans in my head but i once heard this from my Calculus lecturer "ideas wwhich are written in ink are likely to be achieved so I guess I must employ the habit.I will be doing this frequently from now on I think everyday.Yeah so its Farouk and I am out!! <br><em class="top"><a href="#title">To the top</a></em></p>

          Hello again, so its around 8:5pm this has been a short day for me I feel like I wasnt able to achieve anything today. So I started to learn around 2:00pm today but around 3:00 it was like I had forgotten what
            I had learnt, this "made me loose vhim". So I stopped learning and thought I should take a break but I never came back from the break. That is a very negative attitude so I plan on giving
            atleast six hours of practicing everyday from now!!. Change from now!!. There is someone's exibhition of strength that motivates me its like she is a superwoman. She always this positive energy around her. I will like to work with her in the future its lucky to be around her.She is also smart,intelligent and wise. Also her beauty is just overtop she is too beautiful. I have been crushing on her since. So thats all for today. I think I should 
            start preparing to-do lists.<br>

               So I am writting this at 8:28pm in Accra-Ghana.So today I was able to achieve what I told you guys that I was going to do yesterday. So I learnt about the css selectors and their uses it was actually interesting.I think I am on the right course to achieve my goal and InshaAllah I will get there through hardwork, persistence and determination.
                I am also listening to this song right now titled:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvKW085SQ8c" target="_blank"><em>Peter Pan by M24<em></a>.Thats all.<br>

                Today I just feel tired, I dont really know why. I want to move back to my room but I dont think I am going to do that anytime soon I must say. I guess I will just work my way out of here.<strong> HARD WORK AND SMART WORK ARE THe kEYS TO SUCCESS.</strong> You might not understand this now but when I reach my goal for the reason I am learning web design.<span id="reason">I'll leave a link here</span>. So today I was given a chore to do but after completing the first quarter an idea of working smart popped into my head and I decided to explore it.I ended up destroying the machine and now its going to cost my parents some "quid".So I guess that rule doesnt apply to me. I come here to write out my thoughts because I feel like this is all I can do and it is also beneficial and by that I mean <strong><insert>very beneficial</insert></strong>.
                 so today I think I am going to redesign this web page to my liking because my taste for the previous design is dead. I am acctually << going to be doing this every month. Yeah so thats all for today.<br>
